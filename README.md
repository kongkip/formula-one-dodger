Formula One Dodger Game

## Overview
Formula One Dodger is a simple, yet engaging game developed using Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. In this game, the player controls a car that must dodge incoming obstacles. The game increases in difficulty as the player's score increases, with the speed of incoming obstacles gradually increasing.

## Features
- **Player Movement**: Control your car with the left and right arrow keys to dodge obstacles.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Obstacles appear randomly and increase in speed as your score increases.
- **Score Tracking**: Your score increases as you successfully dodge obstacles.
- **Speed Display**: The game shows the current speed of obstacles.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when your car collides with an obstacle.

## Requirements
To run this game, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation
Before running the game, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After installing Python, install Pygame using pip. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game
To start the game, run the Python script. You can use an IDE or the command line to do this. If using the command line, navigate to the folder containing the game's script and type:
